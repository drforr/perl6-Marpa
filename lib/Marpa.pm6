Generally you will pass in the constants MARPA-MAJOR-VERSION, MARPA-MINOR-VERSION, MARPA-MICRO-VERSION as the three arguments to this function; that produces a check that the library in use is compatible with the version of Libmarpa the application or module was compiled against. Compatibility is defined by two things: first the version of the running library is newer than the version required_major.required_minor.required_micro.

      The sequence is lhs_id, and the item to be repeated in the sequence is rhs_id. The sequence must be repeated at least min times, where min is 0 or 1. If separator_id is non-negative, it is a separator symbol.

      If flags & MARPA-PROPER-SEPARATION is non-zero, separation is “proper”, that is, a trailing separator is not allowed. The term proper is based on the idea that properly-speaking, separators should actually separate items.

      Some higher-level Marpa interfaces offer the ability to discard separators in the semantics, and in fact will do this by default. At the Libmarpa level, sequences always “keep separators”. It is up to the programmer to arrange to discard separators, if that is what is desired.

      The sequence RHS, or item, is restricted to a single symbol, and that symbol cannot be nullable. If separator_id is a symbol, it also cannot be a nullable symbol. Nullables on the RHS of sequences are restricted because they lead to highly ambiguous grammars. Grammars of this kind are allowed by Libmarpa, but they must be expressed using BNF rules, not sequence rules. This is for two reasons: First, sequence optimizations would not work in the presence of nullables. Second, since it is not completely clear what an application intends when it asks for a sequence of identical items, some of which are nullable, the user's intent can be more clearly expressed directly in BNF.

      The LHS symbol cannot be the LHS of any other rule, whether a BNF rule or a sequence rule. On an attempt to create an sequence rule with a duplicate LHS, marpa_g_sequence_new() fails, setting the error code to MARPA-ERR-SEQUENCE-LHS-NOT-UNIQUE.

      Sequence rules do not add to the classes of grammar parsed by Libmarpa — a sequence can always be written as BNF rules. When a rule is created with the marpa_g_sequence_new() method, Libmarpa will understand that it is a sequence, and will optimize accordingly. The speedup is often considerable.

      As a reminder, a symbol instance is a symbol at a specific location in the input, and with a specific length. Also, whenever a nulled symbol instance is recognized at a location, it is acceptable at that location, and vice versa.

      When a symbol instance is recognized at a location, it will generate a nulled event or a prediction event, but never both. A symbol instance of zero length, when recognized at a location, generates a nulled event at that location, and does not generate a completion event. A symbol instance of non-zero length, when acceptable at a location, generates a completion event at that location, and does not generate a nulled event.

      When a symbol instance is acceptable at a location, it will generate a nulled event or a prediction event, but never both. A symbol instance of zero length, when acceptable at a location, generates a nulled event at that location, and does not generate a prediction event. A symbol instance of non-zero length, when acceptable at a location, generates a prediction event at that location, and does not generate a nulled event.

      While it is not possible for a symbol instance to generate both a nulled event and a completion event at a location, it is quite possible that a symbol might generate both kinds of event at that location. This is because multiple instances of the same symbol may be recognized at a given location, and these instances will have different lengths. If one instance is recognized at a given location as zero length and a second, non-zero-length, instance is recognized at the same location, the first will generate only nulled events, while the second will generate only completion events. For similar reasons, while a symbol instance will never generate both a null event and a prediction event at a location, multiple instances of the same symbol may do so.

      Zero length derivations can be ambiguous. When a zero length symbol is recognized, all of its zero-length derivations are also considered to be recognized.

      For predicted events to occur, the symbol must be marked as a predicted event symbol. The marpa_g_symbol_is_predicted_event_set() function marks symbol sym_id as a predicted event symbol if value is 1, and unmarks it it as a predicted event symbol if value is 0. The marpa_g_symbol_is_predicted_event() method returns the current value of the predicted event marking for symbol sym_id.

      Marking a prediction event sets its activation status to on. Unmarking a prediction event sets its activation status to off. The prediction event marking cannot be changed once the grammar is precomputed.

      If a prediction event is marked, its activation status can be changed using the marpa_g_prediction_symbol_activate() method. Note that, if a symbol is marked as a prediction event symbol in the recognizer, its prediction event can be deactivated and reactivated in the recognizer.

  #|{ Precomputation is necessary for a recognizer to be generated from a grammar. On success, marpa_g_precompute returns a non-negative number to indicate that it precomputed the grammar without issues. On failure, marpa_g_precompute returns −2.

      Precomputation may return one or more events, which may be queried using the marpa_g_event() method. At this point events only occur when failure is reported, and events always report issues. But application writers should expect future versions to have events which are reported on success, as well as events which do not represent issues.

      A MARPA-EVENT-LOOP-RULES event occurs when there are infinite loop rules (cycles) in the grammar. The presence of one or more of these will cause failure to be reported, but will not prevent the grammar from being precomputed.

      Each MARPA-EVENT-COUNTED-NULLABLE event is a symbol which is a nullable on the right hand side of a sequence rule — a “counted” symbol. The presence of one or more of these will cause failure to be reported, and will prevent the grammar from being precomputed. So that the programmer can fix several at once, these failures are delayed until events are created for all of the counted nullables.

      Each MARPA-EVENT-NULLING-TERMINAL event is a nulling symbol which is also flagged as a terminal. Since terminals cannot be of zero length, this is a logical impossibility. The presence of one or more of these will cause failure to be reported, and will prevent the grammar from being precomputed. So that the programmer can fix several at once, the failure is delayed until events are created for all of the counted nullables.

      Precomputation involves freezing and then thoroughly checking the grammar. Among the reasons for precomputation to fail are the following:

        MARPA-ERR-NO-RULES: The grammar has no rules.
        MARPA-ERR-NO-START-SYMBOL: No start symbol was specified.
        MARPA-ERR-INVALID-START-SYMBOL: A start symbol ID was specified, but it is not the ID of a valid symbol.
        MARPA-ERR-START-NOT-LHS: The start symbol is not on the LHS of any rule.
        MARPA-ERR-UNPRODUCTIVE-START: The start symbol is not productive.
        MARPA-ERR-COUNTED-NULLABLE: A symbol on the RHS of a sequence rule is nullable. Libmarpa does not allow this.
        MARPA-ERR-NULLING-TERMINAL: A terminal is also a nulling symbol. Libmarpa does not allow this. 

      More details of these can be found under the description of the appropriate code. See External error codes.

      marpa_g_precompute() is unusual in that it is possible to treat one of its failures as “advisory”, and to proceed with parsing. If marpa_g_precompute() fails with an error code of MARPA-ERR-GRAMMAR-HAS-CYCLE, parsing can proceed, just as it typically would for success. The grammar will have been precomputed, as calling the marpa_g_is_precomputed() method will confirm.

      Most applications, however, will want to simply treat failure with MARPA-ERR-GRAMMAR-HAS-CYCLE, as simply another failure, and fix the cycles before parsing. Cycles make a grammar infinitely ambiguous, and are considered useless in current practice. Cycles make processing the grammar less efficient, sometimes considerably so. Detection of cycles is returned as failure because that is by far the convenient thing to do for the vast majority of applications.

      value is an integer that represents the value of the token. In applications where the token's actual value is not an integer, it is expected that the application will use this value as a “virtual” value, perhaps finding the actual value by using value to index an array. value is not used inside Libmarpa — it is simply stored to be returned by the valuator as a convenience for the application. Some applications may prefer to track token values on their own, perhaps based on the earleme location and token_id, instead of using Libmarpa's token values.

      A value of 0 is reserved for a now-deprecated feature. Do not use it. For more details on that feature, see the section Valued and unvalued symbols.

      When marpa_r_alternative() is successful, the value of the furthest earleme is set to the greater of its value before the call, and current+length, where current is the value of the current earleme.

      Several error codes leave the recognizer in a fully recoverable state, allowing the application to retry the marpa_r_alternative() method. Retry is efficient, and quite useable as a parsing technique. The error code of primary interest from this point of view is MARPA-ERR-UNEXPECTED-TOKEN-ID, which indicates that the token was not accepted because of its token ID. Retry after this condition is used in several applications, and is called “the Ruby Slippers technique”.

      The error codes MARPA-ERR-DUPLICATE-TOKEN, MARPA-ERR-NO-TOKEN-EXPECTED-HERE and MARPA-ERR-INACCESSIBLE-TOKEN also leave the recognizer in a fully recoverable state, and may also be useable for the Ruby Slippers or similar techniques.

  #|{ This method does the final processing for the current earleme. It then advances the current earleme by one. Note that marpa_r_earleme_complete() may be called even when no tokens have been read at the current earleme — in the character-per-earleme input model, for example, tokens can span many characters and, if the input is unambiguous over that span, there will be no other tokens that start inside it.

      As mentioned, marpa_r_earleme_complete() always advances the current earleme, incrementing its value by 1. This means that value of the current earleme after the call will be the one plus the value of the earleme processed by the call to marpa_r_earleme_complete(). If any token was accepted at the earleme being processed, marpa_r_earleme_complete() creates a new Earley set which will be the latest Earley set and, after the call, the latest earleme will be equal to the new current earleme. If no token was accepted at the earleme being processed, no Earley set is created, and the value of the latest earleme remains unchanged. The value of the furthest earleme is never changed by a call to marpa_r_earleme_complete().

    During this method, one or more events may occur. On success, this function returns the number of events generated, but it is important to note that events may be created whether earleme completion fails or succeeds. When this method fails, the application must call marpa_g_event() if it wants to determine if any events occurred. Since the reason for failure to complete an earleme is often detailed in the events, applications that fail will often be at least as interested in the events as those that succeed.

      The MARPA-EVENT-EARLEY-ITEM-THRESHOLD event indicates that an application-settable threshold on the number of Earley items has been reached or exceeded. What this means depends on the application, but when the default threshold is exceeded, it means that it is very likely that the time and space resources consumed by the parse will prove excessive.

      A parse is “exhausted” when it can accept no more input. This can happen both on success and on failure. Note that the failure due to parse exhaustion only means failure at the current earleme. There may be successful parses at earlier earlemes.

      If a parse is exhausted, but successful, an event with the event code MARPA-EVENT-EXHAUSTED occurs. Because the parse is exhausted, no input will be accepted at later earlemes. It is quite common for a parse to become exhausted when it succeeds. Many practical grammars are designed so that a successful parse cannot be extended.

      An exhausted parse may cause a failure, in which case marpa_r_earleme_complete() returns an error whose error code is MARPA-ERR-PARSE-EXHAUSTED. For a parse to fail at an earleme due to exhaustion, it must be the case that no alternatives were accepted at that earleme. In fact, in the standard input model, a failure due to parse exhaustion occurs if and only if no alternatives were accepted at the current earleme.

      The circumstances under which failure due to parse exhaustion occurs are slightly more complicated when variable length tokens are in use. Informally, a parse will never fail due to exhaustion as long as it is possible that a token ending at some future earleme will continue the parse. More precisely, a call to marpa_r_earleme_complete() fails due to parse exhaustion if and only if, first, no alternatives were added at the current earleme and, second, that call left the current earleme equal to the furthest earleme.

      At this writing, there is no method for the inverse operation (conversion of an earleme to an Earley set ID). One consideration in writing such a method is that not all earlemes correspond to Earley sets. Applications that want to map earlemes to Earley sets will have no trouble if they are using the standard input model — the Earley set ID is always exactly equal to the earleme in that model.
